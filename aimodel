To develop an AI-based article writer tool that can write articles in a specific language, you would need to have a good understanding and knowledge of the following things:

Natural Language Processing (NLP) - NLP is a field of study that deals with the interaction between computers and human languages. You will need to have a good understanding of NLP to process and analyze text data in the desired language.

Machine Learning - Machine learning is the backbone of AI-based systems. You need to have a good understanding of machine learning algorithms and techniques to train your model.

Data Collection and Cleaning - You will need to collect data in the desired language and clean it to make it suitable for your model.

Programming Languages - You will need to have a good understanding of programming languages such as Python, Java, or C++ to develop the tool.

Text Processing Libraries - You will need to have knowledge of text processing libraries such as NLTK, Spacy, or TextBlob to perform tasks such as tokenization, stemming, and lemmatization.

Cloud Computing - Cloud computing can be used to process large amounts of data and train machine learning models.

Language-specific tools - You will need to use language-specific tools such as word embeddings, language models, and other language-specific datasets to improve the accuracy of your model.

Evaluation Metrics - You will need to have knowledge of evaluation metrics such as precision, recall, F1 score, and accuracy to evaluate the performance of your model.

Overall, developing an AI-based article writer tool that can write articles in a specific language requires a broad range of skills and knowledge, and it can be a challenging but rewarding project.
